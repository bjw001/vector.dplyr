#' Vertica.dplyR is an R package developed by HP that provides Vertica-backend support for the [dplyr][1] package. Besides support of standard dplyr functionality (such as table manipulation), vertica.dplyr also features:
#'
#'
#' * [HPdata][4]-style functions (data transport from Vertica to Distributed R via the data loader), namely tbl2d**object** (where **object** is either **array** or **frame**), that are compatible with dplyr tbl objects.
#' * Easy CSV-loading into Vertica.
#' * copy_to functionality that takes advantage of Vertica's fast **COPY LOCAL** feature.
#' * Connectivity to Vertica through either JDBC or ODBC.
#' * (Future Feature) Seamless Vertica UDx invocation.
